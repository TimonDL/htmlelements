= HtmlElements

version: 2.0

Second generation of the HtmlElements library is indeed a yet another WebDriver wrapper, but
with a couple of fresh ideas:

. Hierarchy of page objects for your application is now a very flexible composition of java interfaces.
. A lot of additional control over elements behaviour is available via extension methods implemented in a fluent manner.
. Actually, pretty much everything is extensible for your convenience: the library provides a baseline design
for your project, allowing you to fine-tune the specifics.
